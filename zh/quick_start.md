# Quick Start

## High Level Overview

Wails applications consist of 2 parts:

  * A backend written in Go
  * A frontend written using standard HTML/JS/CSS

These are compiled and bundled together using the `wails build` command. This will firstly build the frontend project into Javascript and CSS bundles. It will then build the main Go application, which bundles the 2 frontend asset files as part of the application. This produces a single application.

### Frontend

The frontend is a standard frontend project (Vue, React, etc) that gets compiled down to Javascript and CSS bundles. It lives in the `frontend` directory of the project. There is nothing particularly special about the project other than it is configured to bundle the whole project down to 2 bundles: app.js and app.css.

### Backend

The backend initially comprises of a single main.go file:

```go
package main

import (
  "github.com/leaanthony/mewn"
  "github.com/wailsapp/wails"
)

func basic() string {
  return "Hello World!"
}

func main() {

  js := mewn.String("./frontend/dist/app.js")
  css := mewn.String("./frontend/dist/app.css")

  app := wails.CreateApp(&wails.AppConfig{
    Width:  1024,
    Height: 768,
    Title:  "Quotes",
    JS:     js,
    CSS:    css,
    Colour: "#131313",
  })
  app.Bind(basic)
  app.Run()
}
```
Here is a quick explanation of how this works:

| Lines    | Explanation                                                    |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | The standard package directive.                                |
| 3-6      | Imports the Wails framework and the Mewn utility package that we will use for handling assets.                                                            |
| 8-10     | A standard Go function that returns the string "Hello World!". |
| 12       | The main function declaration.                                 |
| 14       | Reads in the frontend javascript bundle as a string.           |
| 15       | Reads in the frontend css bundle as a string.                  |
| 17-24    | Creates a new Wails application, specifying width, height, title and a colour for the application window. We also specify the Javascript and CSS we wish the application to render - the JS/CSS we previously read in on lines 14 & 15.              |
| 25       | Binds our basic function to the application. We can then call this method from Javascript using `window.backend.basic()`.                  |
| 26       | Runs the application.                                          |

If you make changes to the frontend or backend, you simply have to run `wails build` to regenerate your application.


## Prerequisites

Wails uses cgo to bind to the native rendering engines so a number of platform dependent libraries are needed as well as an installation of Go. The basic requirements are:

- Go 1.12 or above
- npm

Run `go version && npm --version` to verify.

### MacOS

Make sure you have the xcode command line tools installed. This can be done by running:

`xcode-select --install`

### Linux

#### Debian/Ubuntu

`sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev`

_Debian: 8, 9, 10_

_Ubuntu: 16.04, 18.04, 19.04_

_Also succesfully tested on: Zorin 15, Parrot 4.7, Linuxmint 19, Elementary 5, Kali, Neon_

#### Arch Linux

`sudo pacman -S webkit2gtk gtk3`

_Also succesfully test on: ArcoLinuxB, Manjaro_

#### Centos

`sudo yum install webkitgtk3-devel gtk3-devel`

_CentOS 6, 7_

#### Fedora

`sudo yum install webkit2gtk3-devel gtk3-devel`

_Fedora 29, 30_

#### VoidLinux & VoidLinux-musl

`xbps-install gtk+3-devel webkit2gtk-devel`

#### Gentoo

`sudo emerge gtk+:3 webkit-gtk`

::: tip
If you have successfully installed these dependencies on a different flavour of Linux, please consider clicking the "Edit this page" link at the bottom and submit a PR.
:::

### Windows

Windows requires gcc and related tooling. The recommended download is from [http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/download](http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/download). Once this is installed, you are good to go.



## Installation

### Preparation

Ensure Go modules are enabled:

`export GO111MODULE=on`

and go/bin is in your PATH variable:

`echo $PATH | grep go/bin`

### Install

Installation is as simple as running the following command:

<pre style='color:white'>
go get github.com/wailsapp/wails/cmd/wails
</pre>

::: tip
Once installed, the `wails update` command may be used for subsequent updates.
:::

### Setup

To finish the installation setup your Wails system by running the [setup command](./reference/#setup) `wails setup` and filling your handle and email.

## Generate a new project

Generate a new project using the [init command](./reference/#init) `wails init`.

Select the default options.

## Build it!

Change into the project directory `cd my-project` and compile your application using the [build command](./reference/#build) `wails build`.

If all went well, you should have a compiled program in your local directory. Run it with `./my-project` or double click `myproject.exe` if on windows.

<div class="imagecontainer">
<img src="/media/app.png" style="width:65%">
</div>

### Serve

#### `wails serve`

While developing your apps using wails the preferred method is by the [serve command](./reference/#serve) `wails serve`.

::: tip
This produces a much **faster** lightweight build in _debug_ mode, excluding `npm` build scripts, saving time when developing the backend and also enabling use of `npm run serve` for partial browser development of frontend!
:::

#### `npm run serve`

Change into the frontend directory `cd my-project/frontend` and serve your GUI using `npm run serve`.


## Next Steps

If you would like to start making an app right away, we suggest you explore Wails via our _awesome_ [tutorials](./tutorials/).
If you would prefer to get to know the framework a little better before building anything, we suggest having a look through the
[concepts](./home.html#concepts).
Finally if you are advanced user and would like to get right in to it head over to the [API reference](./reference/#api) & [Cli reference](./reference/#cli) sections.
